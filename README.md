# DeepLearningAndGo

Code adapted from the Manning book Deep Learning and the Game of Go

https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-and-the-game-of-go

# Author's code repository

I plan to use this code as starter code for other projects once the book has been completed and I've finished working through it
